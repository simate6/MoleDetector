Topic: Mole detection with deep learning

<h2 align="center">I. milestone</h2>

### 1.1 Motivation
The current neural networks are developed for diagnose melanoma based on dermatoscopic images. On the other hand, during consultations we determined a different kind of approach. Our goal is to mark the moles on pictures which are taken from different distances at different angles, resolutions and lighting conditions. The "cutouts" could be later used for detailed investigation or mole appareance follow-up.

### 1.2 Main tasks during the semester
* Data acquistion & preprocess
* Train
* Data augmentation
* Hyperparameter tuning

Regarding the <i>I. milestone</i> our task is invloving data acquisiton, labeling, preprocessing standardization and in general to make an organized dataset which will be later applicable for training purposes.
